# Setup instructions

As this is a workshop, you will need a laptop with **R** and **Rstudio** pre-installed.
We won't have time to help you with the installation, so please make sure that
your system is working ahead of time. This is especially important if you have a
computer from your employer. _Please_ talk to your IT people ahead of time to make sure that

## Installing **R**

**R** needs to be installed first. You can get the program here:
https://cran.r-project.org/index.html

Next, you need to install **RStudio**. You can get it from here:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/


Please run **RStudio** _before_ attending the workshop to be sure that everything
is working properly.

## Installing `CSHShydRology`

The Workshop is based on the `CSHShydRology` package, so you will need to have it
installed ahead of time. You can do this inside **RStudio** by selecting the
**Packages** tab and clicking the "Install" button.

Now type CSHShydrology into the dialog box. Make sure that the checkbox
"Install dependencies" is selected and click the **Install** button.

`CSHShydRology` requires the use of the package `whitebox`. which also
requires an executable program to be installed. You can do this inside 
**RStudio** with the following commands:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
library(whitebox)
install_whitebox()
```

## Other programs and packages

### ggplot2

The package **ggplot2** is used very widely for graphs. We have a few exercises which
use it, so it would be a good idea to install it. It is installed in the
same was as `CSHShydRology`.

### Rmarkdown
We will be using the package `rmarkdown` to create documents, so you should
also install it. This allows you to create html documents. If you want to
be able to export .pdf and .docx files, you will also need to install the program
**Pandoc**   
https://pandoc.org/installing.html  
and **LaTeX**. Note that the **Pandoc** installation page also shows where you can obtain
**LaTeX** for your system.

### git

**git** is a distributed version control program. We will be showing how to
use **git** with **RStudio** to manage the versions of your files. You can
install **git** from here:  
https://git-scm.com/downloads  


# Setting up your workspace

The data files needed for these exercises can all be downloaded from **GitHub**,
at <https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/CWRA_2022_R_workshop>. 
Note that to get the files you _must_ have an account on **GitHub**, which is free.

To get the data,   
1.  Go to <https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/CWRA_2022_R_workshop/releases/tag/v0.9>  
2.  Under **Assets** click on **Source code (zip)**  
![](figures/assets.png){width=30%}  
3.  Download the .zip file to a folder on your hard drive.  
4.  Extract the .zip file  

This will create all of the folders that are required, with all of the data files
that we will be using.

`/tutorials`  - contains the tutorials that you will be working through  
`/slides`  - contains all the slide presentations  
`/data` - contains all the data sets required to complete the exercises  
`/output` - where your code will write output  

## Building packages

We will be showing how you can build packages in **R**. This requires installing
the package `devtools`. Make sure that all the dependencies (there are many!) 
are installed.
