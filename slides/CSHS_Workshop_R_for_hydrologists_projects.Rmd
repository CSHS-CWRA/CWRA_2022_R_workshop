## Why create a project?
- Makes your code more reproducible
- Keeps code separate from other projects
- Lets your code work with `git` and **GitHub**
- Basis for creating packages


## How to create a project
- Command is **File | New Project**
- Several alternatives appear

## Decisions, decisions....
- New Directory  
   - allows you to create any type of project, including packages 
   - can use **git** (always a good idea), _but_
   - _won't_ work with **GitHub**
  
- Existing Directory  
   - only creates a simple project
   - doesn't set up **git**, but you can add it later
   - _won't_ work with **GitHub**

- Version Control  
    - clones a project from a repository like **GitHub** or **GitLab**
    - project has to be set up on the repository _first_


## .Rproj file
- Every project contains a project file (`project_name.Rproj`)
  - a text file which contains the project settings
- Double-clicking on the file in your file manager will load **RStudio** with
the project
    - default directory will be set to the project directory
- Can also load a project manually in **RStudio** using  
**File | Open Project** or   
**File | Recent Projects**
- You can only have one project open at a time
  - opening a project will close your current project
  
## git
- **git** is a program for version control 
- Created by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux)
- Allows you to manage versions of your documents
- **RStudio** allows you to do most operations without typing commands
  - if you screw up, you _will_ have to type **git** commands
- Can sync with **GitHub**

## Working with git
- **git** is based on _branches_
  - each branch is a separate set of files
- There is always a **main** (or **master**) branch
  - best version of the files
- When a branch is ready, it can be merged into the **main** branch
- You can switch between branches at any time

## git branches
- _ALWAYS_ create a new branch before working on a project
  - if you don't it will be a PITA
